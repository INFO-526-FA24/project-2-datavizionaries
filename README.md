# Project Description

This project uses the ‘Mental Health Dataset’ sourced from Kaggle. It was prepared by Mr Bhavik Jikdara by extracting the required information from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/) . The dataset contains a variety of features related to text analysis, psychological indicators, stress, isolation and behavioral attributes making it suitable to visualize and get insights into mental health.

The goal is to discover correlations and patterns between various aspects of one's life. These insights can be used to develop policies and support systems promoting mental well-being.
